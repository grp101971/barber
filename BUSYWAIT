BUSY WAIT:

let us consider that there is only one shop in the entire city. so all the
customers would wait for the availability of the chairs int the shop. for that
they repeatedly check for the chairs and keep waiting untill the chair is
available. this is known as busy waiting

this can be implemented as follows:



#define chairs n
void barber(void)
{
while(TRUE)
{
down(&customers);
down(&mutex);
--waiting;
up(&barber);
up(&mutex);
cut_hair();
}
}

void customer(void)
{
down(&mutex);
if(waiting<chairs)
{
++waiting;
up(&customers);
up(&mutex);
down(&barber);
get_haircut();
}
else
up(&mutex);
}
}


SPIN LOCK:

 a spinlock is a lock which causes a thread trying to acquire it to simply wait
in a loop ("spin") while repeatedly checking if the lock is available.
